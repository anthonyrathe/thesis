- include growth features
- include trend label feature
- train agents on different peer groups
- go to https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/accessing-edgar-data.htm for up-to-date cik, bulk data download, ...
- eliminate trades that are too small (e.g. changes < 1/(10*#stocks))

    KO -> PEP -> MNST -> KDP (each 1500 timesteps) and evaluate on KDP
- think about testing: how can we rigorously test timeseries-predictions?
- try if learning on one peer set also works for other peer sets
